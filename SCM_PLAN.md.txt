# Software Configuration Management (SCM) Plan

## 1. SCM Objectives
The goal of this SCM plan is to ensure the integrity and reliability of the **Book Catalog Service** project. Key objectives include:
* **Traceability:** Every change in the code must be tracked with a clear commit message and author, allowing us to know "who changed what and when."
* **Quality:** Using Pull Requests and code reviews to prevent bugs from reaching the production branch.
* **Reliability:** Ensuring that the `main` branch is always stable and deployable.

## 2. Branching Strategy: Git Flow
We have selected **Git Flow** as our branching strategy.
* **Main Branch (`main`):** Contains the production-ready code.
* **Feature Branches (`feat/...`):** Created from `main` for developing new features.
* **Hotfix Branches:** Used for quick fixes.

### Justification for Selection
Git Flow was chosen because it provides a strict structure that separates "work in progress" (Features) from the "stable product" (Main). This is ideal for our team collaboration to minimize conflicts and ensure stability.
